Starting From Scratch
====================

Are you looking to work with the open source hearing aid?  Have you never worked with Arduino before?  This document hopes to help you get started.

Arduino Basics
---------

If you really have no experience with Arduino, you should get a basic Arduino try a couple of the introductory tutorials.  If you can complete the first couple examples, you will know that the Arduino software environment is working correctly.

* **Hardware**: You could start with a bare [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno), but I recommend a starter pack like this one: https://www.adafruit.com/products/193

* **Software**: Download the latest Arduino software, also known as the Arduino IDE ("Integrated Development Environment").  Be sure to get it from Arduino.cc, not Arduino.org.  You can get the Arduino IDE from this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

* **Install**: After downloading, you can follow the installation instructions for your platform: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage

* **Quick Start**:  Here's the Arduino Quick Start for the Arduino Uno.  It gets you to compile and upload the "Blink" program, which is always where you should start.  This is totally the key first step: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno

More Arduino Tutorials
------------

Once you got the Blink program to work, you can try a few more of the built-in examples.  The full list of examples are described on the Arduino site [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples).  Unfortunately, this Arduino page isn't sorted into any sort of order.  I think that you should do the example programs in this order:

* **Blink**:  Turn an LED on and off.  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink
* **Digital Read Serial**: Read a switch, print the state out to the Arduino Serial Monitor  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalReadSerial
* **Analog Read Serial**: Read a potentiometer, print its state out to the Arduino Serial Monitor. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogReadSerial

Once you have completed these three tutorials using the basic Arduino Uno, you'll know that the Arduino IDE is working correctly and that you know how to use the IDE to compile and upload code.  You'll also know how to use the Serial Monitor to see text produced by the Arduino, which is the primary method for debugging programs.
